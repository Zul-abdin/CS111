Recursion
    Is not the same as ITERATIVE code
        ITERATIVE code uses LOOPS
    RECURSIVE code uses recursion

        A Recursive algorithm must:
            1. Have a base case
            2. Change its state and move toward the bare case (recursive case)
            3. Call itself recursively


Factorial:
    1! = 1  <---- Base Case
    2! = 2 * 1
    3! = 3 * 2 * 1
    4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

    Generally, n! = n * (n-1)!

Now, lets make Factorial recursive:

    Factorial (n)
        IF n equals 1 THEN  <----- Base Case
            RETURN 1
        ELSE
            RETURN n * Factorial (n-1)  <----- Moves towards the Base case
        ENDIF
